# Gradient Bang Client

Monorepo workspace containing the game client and 3D starfield library, built with pnpm and Turbo.

```

## Quickstart

> [!NOTE]
> The game client looks best with the [TX-02 Berkeley Mono](https://usgraphics.com/products/berkeley-mono) typeface. Grab a license and place it in `app/src/assets/fonts/tx-02.woff2`.

```bash
# Install and configure
pnpm i
cp app/env.example app/.env

# Dev mode (with hot reload & devtools)
pnpm run dev

# Preview mode (optimized, production-like)
pnpm run preview
```

> [!NOTE]
> The game client requires the local Supabase stack (edge functions) and the Pipecat bot to be running. See the root README for setup instructions.

### Dev vs Preview

- **Dev mode**: Hot reload, Leva devtools, no PWA
- **Preview mode**: Production build, asset caching, PWA enabled

## Packages

### `/app`

Browser game client built with Vite, React 19, and TypeScript.

- Connects via WebRTC to the Pipecat bot for voice-driven gameplay
- Fetches data from Supabase edge functions
- State managed via Zustand
- UI built with Radix primitives and Tailwind CSS 4
- Animation via React Spring and Motion

### `/starfield`

3D space graphics library using Three.js and React Three Fiber. Bundled as an ES module consumed by the app as a workspace dependency (not published to npm).

- Custom GLSL shaders (galaxy, nebula, sun, tunnel, planets)
- Post-processing pipeline (dithering, exposure, color grading, shockwave)
- Performance profiles (low/mid/high/extreme) with GPU auto-detection
- Frame-on-demand rendering

## Environment Variables

Configure in `app/.env` (see `app/env.example`). All are optional.

| `VITE_BOT_URL`                     | `http://localhost:7860`               | Bot start URL (SmallWebRTC direct connect). Also used in Ladle                            |
| `VITE_MAINTENANCE_MODE`            | —                                     | Set to any truthy value to show maintenance screen                                        |

| `VITE_APP_VERSION`                 | from `package.json`                   | Injected at build time via `vite.config.ts` — not user-set                                |

## Development

### Storybook

Component sandbox using [Ladle](https://ladle.dev):

```bash
pnpm run dev:stories

# or run both dev server and stories
pnpm run dev:all
```

### Settings

Runtime settings are stored in local storage. Hardcoded overrides can be set in `app/src/settings.json` (takes priority over local storage). Covers audio, performance presets, 3D rendering, mic input, and asset caching.

## CI / CD

Automated via GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/`):

- **CI** (`ci.yml`): Runs lint + build on PRs targeting `main` (when `client/` files change)
- **Deploy** (`deploy.yml`): Vercel preview on PR, production deploy on merge to `main`

The licensed font is fetched from private Supabase Storage during CI.

### Pre-commit Hooks

[Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) runs [lint-staged](https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged) on every commit, auto-fixing ESLint and Prettier issues on staged `.ts`/`.tsx` files.

### Notes

- `app` depends on the `starfield` package. Turbo handles build order automatically.
- Do **not** enable the Vercel GitHub integration — deploys are handled entirely via GitHub Actions.
