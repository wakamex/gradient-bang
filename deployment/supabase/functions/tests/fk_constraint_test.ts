/**
 * Integration tests for foreign key constraint edge cases.
 *
 * These tests reproduce FK constraint violations that occur when entities
 * (corporations, characters, ships) are deleted while the events table still
 * holds references to them.
 *
 * Known FK columns on `events` (all default to RESTRICT — no ON DELETE action):
 *   - character_id  → characters(character_id)
 *   - sender_id     → characters(character_id)
 *   - ship_id       → ship_instances(ship_id)
 *   - corp_id       → corporations(corp_id)
 *
 * Tests cover:
 *   1. Corp disband with corp ships that have events (pseudo-character FK)
 *   2. Corp disband after corp-scoped events exist (corp_id FK)
 *   3. Direct: deleting a ship that has event references (ship_id FK)
 *   4. Direct: deleting a character that has event references (character_id FK)
 *
 * Setup: 2 players in sector 0 (mega-port).
