    Sent by VoiceAgent when a game event arrives on the game_client.

    Broadcast (no target) so all TaskAgent children receive it.

    Parameters:
        event: The game event dict (has event_name, payload, etc.).
        voice_agent_originated: True if the event was triggered by a VoiceAgent
            tool call (request_id is in VoiceAgent's recent request_id cache).
            TaskAgents use this to ignore errors from the VoiceAgent's own calls
            so they don't affect TaskAgent completion tracking or error counts.
